title: Why I Believe Artificial General Intelligence Has Already Been Invented
---

(draft/outline/notes stage)

### YAID (Yet Another Intelligence Definition)

Intelligent means "effective in a complex context".  For example, effectively
solving problems such as finding a good move in Go or Chess (See 
[Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) 
[AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)) or effectively generating
a series of sounds that will be appealing to a mate 
(I could give an example like Justin Beiber, but this is 
highly subjective context, so such examples are certain to 
elicit longing in some individuals while
simultaneously inducing intense nausea in others.)

### General Intelligence

General intelligence means effective in all contexts that people are
 familiar with.

The most general context or domain, which humans share with animals, is that of
sensory inputs, motor outputs, and time -- in all of the particular
and varied environments humans and animals find themselves on earth.  
You _may_ separate reward signals as a very key class of sensory inputs
that can be placed in their own category.

Human intelligence is just a higher degree of animal intelligence.

### Animal Intelligence and Human Intelligence

Intelligent cat behavior examples LOL...

High bandwidth stream of aligned/integrated sense inputs, processing, high bandwidth stream of aligned/integrated motor outputs, leading to inputs that cause increased
reward signals.

Time and sequence as key part of sense inputs.  Self as center of input, relation to
time, motor outputs, reward signals, etc.

Efficient/parallel computation allows for processing high bandwidth streams
Pattern recognition and generation used a general purpose type of communication
based on compression/decompression/combination of complex signals.

### Emulating Animals

Limitations of existing robots.  Lack of granularity and dexterity of movement.
Stuck on Disney Animatronics.  Number of muscles, degrees of movement, etc.
in actual animals and humans versus robots.  Video game characters using
recorded movements.

More dexterous robots and generating dynamic movements and responses 
using deep learning techniques.

### Dualism and "Life"


### Westworld's Bicameral Mind and Real AI Consciousness

Westworld quote, Jeurgen-Schmit (what's his name) quote

### Deep Mind AI Lab, OpenAI Universe, etc.

### Grounded Deep Learning Papers/Projects

### We are just Waiting for More Impressive Demos

"Eureaka!" moment will come from refinement and integration of existing techniques
rather than a truly new discovery.
